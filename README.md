## Aden Hive is growing fast 🐝

5,000+ [GitHub stars](https://github.com/adenhq/hive) in ~10 days.

I contribute to **Aden Hive** - an open-source, outcome-driven agent framework
built for production, not demos.

Hive focuses on agents that:
- evolve from failures
- run real business processes
- have cost limits, observability, and human-in-the-loop control

I work inside the ecosystem helping shape how these agents are built
and how they survive in the real world.
